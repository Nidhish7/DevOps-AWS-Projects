# 🚀 DevOps & AWS Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **DevOps-AWS Projects** repository! This repo contains hands-on projects that showcase my skills in
**Cloud Infrastructure**, **Automation**, and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, **Jenkins**, and **Bash scripting**.All projects are designed to be deployable within the **AWS Free Tier** or locally, making them ideal for learning, testing, and portfolio demonstration.

Each project is designed to reflect real-world scenarios and follows DevOps best practices. I continuously update this repository as I learn and build more.

## 📌 Notes

> 🔒 **Security First:** No credentials are stored in this repo. AWS access is handled via `aws configure` and IAM roles. `.gitignore` ensures sensitive files (e.g., `terraform.tfvars`) are excluded from commits. Always avoid hardcoding secrets or uploading them to public repositories. Use environment variables or secret managers in production.

> ✅ All projects are built within the **AWS Free Tier**.
